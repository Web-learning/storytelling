## Lesson Repository

Mozilla have created this Lesson Template (it's part of their Study Group Repository) for you to use to structure any notes, guides, challenges, or examples you share in session. 

Once you’ve created your lesson notes using the template, and tested out your lesson with your Study Group, we hope you’ll add it to the Study Group Lesson repository. This repo enables skills-sharing among Study Groups worldwide. Anyone can access these open resources; it’s a way of maximizing the learning potential and power of all our Groups, worldwide.

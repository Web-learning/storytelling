This Lesson Template is intended to structure any notes, guides, 
challenges, or examples shared about storytelling

Once you’ve created your lesson notes using the template, 
and tested out your lesson with your Study Group, we 
hope you’ll add it to the Study Group Lesson repository. 
This repo enables skills-sharing among Study Groups worldwide. 
Anyone can access these open resources; it’s a way of maximizing 
the learning potential and power of all our Groups, worldwide.
